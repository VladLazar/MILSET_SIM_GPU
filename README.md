Rutherford experimetn GPU accelerated sim.<br>
In order to run:<br>
1. Run kernel.cu with nvcc compirler<br>
2. Paste output data into out txt file<br>
3. Run the python draw.py to get scattering<br>
<br>
sim.py is a simulation of the Rutherford experiment based on ray-casting tehniques. It outputs in foo.txt. You can see the scatering by using the draw.py, however don't forget to modify the input file for draw.py.
